      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I just wanted to make a quick blog post about the project (mainly the UI). In my last post I stated that MetroUI 4 was being replaced with Bootstrap 5. As apart of those changes; I have created new wallpapers for the project (to give the &amp;lsquo;Tablet UI&amp;rsquo; something unique).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello, as you may know, the project has went through a &amp;lsquo;development reset&amp;rsquo; as I did not like the way how Questbook went.
MetroUI 4 was clunky and outdated (latest release was from 2017 and had some CSS / Javascript issues). So, I decided to scrap the start menu idea and went with something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t too messy, witch is why Bootstrap 5 is being used.
However, you can still add the start menu just by creating a custom HTML file and re-routing the file to appear above the default homescreen, again.</description>
