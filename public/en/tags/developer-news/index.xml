      <description>Hello, as you may know, the project has went through a &amp;lsquo;development reset&amp;rsquo; as I did not like the way how Questbook went.
MetroUI 4 was clunky and outdated (latest release was from 2017 and had some CSS / Javascript issues). So, I decided to scrap the start menu idea and went with something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t too messy, witch is why Bootstrap 5 is being used.
However, you can still add the start menu just by creating a custom HTML file and re-routing the file to appear above the default homescreen, again.</description>
