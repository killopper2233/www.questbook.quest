Hello, as you may know, the project has went through a 'development reset' as I did not like the way how Questbook went.

MetroUI 4 was clunky and outdated (latest release was from 2017 and had some CSS / Javascript issues). So, I decided to scrap the start menu idea and went with something that wasn't too messy, witch is why Bootstrap 5 is being used. 


However, you can still add the start menu just by creating a custom HTML file and re-routing the file to appear above the default homescreen, again. With this project being open source; there is no doubt that you cannot change the homescreen to your liking.

In future builds of Questbook Embedded, that may be less difficult and more easier for non-developers to change & configure Questbook via the settings application as I want this operating environment focus on reliablilty, security and UI features.
