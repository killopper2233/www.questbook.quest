Hello, I just wanted to make a quick blog post about the project (mainly the UI). In my last post I stated that MetroUI 4 was being replaced with Bootstrap 5. As apart of those changes; I have created new wallpapers for the project (to give the 'Tablet UI' something unique).

As you can tell, I am obsessed with Google's design language therefore, I have based my whole entire project on their design language. Although Bootstrap isn't meant to re-create the iconic homescreen from Android 5.0 (or maybe it is), I still want to atleast try to do it. 

So, from now on. Future versions of Questbook Embedded as of v8.90.0 will feature the Material Design. If you don't like this change, you can always remove it for something else (such as MetroUI, or just plain vanilla CSS).
